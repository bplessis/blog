Hi,

Well there is a first for everything. After fifteen year of almost pure linux/debian sysadmin, and seeing all this lunatic development under the "devops" banner, where stability is a curse, this year i wanted to try something different. So no "docker" here, well not until it's really suitable for production use (and provided we do have a use for it), but something older and probably better (at least that's what he said), called FreeBSD.

I just got a new server, taking advantage of this year's sale period i got myself a beefy eight-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1231 v3 @ 3.40GHz with 32Gb of RAM and two 1TB HDD for 20â‚¬ a month.

I will try and wrote here my experience with this new OS, also it put in once or twice a few linux tricks, or, god forbid a few photographic elements.

That's all for the intro.
