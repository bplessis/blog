Hi back i guess ? :)
Years have passed, the previous engine setup proved unreliable, update to jekyll, ruby, and whatever keep breaking up the thing in all ways i could not even think of.
Jekyll-assets particularly seem to have a pretty hard time keeping up with the ecosystem, so &amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s try another way ?
