However as it seem this client has a tendancy to misbehave and trigger the hosting provider DOS defense mechanism (mainly rebooting the serveur after disabling dhcp service autorisations, not fun).
While checking around with friend it seems i wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first one hit by this and that the solution was to switch over to ISC&amp;rsquo;s dhcp service, with a little twist (freebsd package for isc-dhcp doesn&amp;rsquo;t include an init script for dhcpv6).</description></item></channel></rss>
