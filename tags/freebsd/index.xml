However as it seem this client has a tendancy to misbehave and trigger the hosting provider DOS defense mechanism (mainly rebooting the serveur after disabling dhcp service autorisations, not fun).
While checking around with friend it seems i wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first one hit by this and that the solution was to switch over to ISC&amp;rsquo;s dhcp service, with a little twist (freebsd package for isc-dhcp doesn&amp;rsquo;t include an init script for dhcpv6).</description></item><item><title>Upgrading the blog, day 1</title><link>/blog/2018/04/16/Upgrading-the-blog-day-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2018/04/16/Upgrading-the-blog-day-1/</guid><description>A year has past since the beginning of this little experiment, and some results are already showing:
i&amp;rsquo;m not very prolific ^^ i&amp;rsquo;m becoming more and more grumpy i don&amp;rsquo;t like my blog&amp;rsquo;s setup (but didn&amp;rsquo;t find better for now) . So yeah, new year was 4 month ago and still nothing new here, my article on bind, dnssec and knot hasn&amp;rsquo;t moved further, but work-related issues send me back here to make some experiments, our SEO consultants where reportings issues on our client&amp;rsquo;s website and where in need of informations.</description></item><item><title>Drive Failure and reinstall</title><link>/blog/2017/10/30/Drive-Failure-and-reinstall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/10/30/Drive-Failure-and-reinstall/</guid><description>Hi,
This weekend was one of thoses weekend &amp;hellip; Sunday morning while trying to destroy an unused jail i got a zfs warning: &amp;ldquo;pool is degraded&amp;rdquo;.
As it turn out i was missing a drive in my zfs mirror setup, so heck .. no fun.
After a few email with the hosting company they recommended i migrate over a new server, which is running ok if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this ;).</description></item><item><title>Poudriere</title><link>/blog/2017/05/05/Poudriere/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/05/05/Poudriere/</guid><description>In some cases you might need to use some customisation over the standard pre-built packages repository. Two choices there: you can either manually build them using the ports system on each of your jails/servers, or you can make a custom pkg repository with your build options.
This is what i will show here, using the poudriere build system, a creation by the same author of pkg, bapt, a good guy (yes yes ;) ) who has coped with me during many FreeBSD rants (well he wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one, thanks Keltia , nerzhul, renchap and others for your precious help).</description></item><item><title>Setting up jails</title><link>/blog/2017/02/27/Setting-up-jails/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/02/27/Setting-up-jails/</guid><description>The main idea of this new setup is to try and isolate services for the main host, which should be only used for management.
So every service will be run in it&amp;rsquo;s own context, known as jails in the Free/Net/OpenBSD lingua.
However a few helping services on the host might be usefull, for DNS resolving, log collection, &amp;hellip;
Service IP Since i don&amp;rsquo;t own a lot of IPv4 public adresses, some a private IPv4 network will be used for accessing services in this network familly, and some NAT will have to be set.</description></item><item><title>Firewalling: PF</title><link>/blog/2017/02/19/Firewalling-PF/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/02/19/Firewalling-PF/</guid><description>So, now we have some basis of a working system.
Time to think about protecting if, while the Internet is the place to be it&amp;rsquo;s also a kind of a bad place, moreover when you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a known hosting company.
Firewalling So, we have to play with FreeBSD firewall solution: PF, as in Packet Filter.
Configuring So first thing is to setup a few rules in the /etc/pf.</description></item><item><title>Configuration Time</title><link>/blog/2017/02/14/Configuration-Time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/02/14/Configuration-Time/</guid><description>Hi there,
Taking over where i left before, so now i do have a fresh and shiny new machine, time to set it up.
The Base System FreeBSD contrarious to linux system is separated into two main part, the main part is the &amp;ldquo;base system&amp;rdquo;, basically it&amp;rsquo;s what FreeBSD is, and is released and updated as a whole.
To keep the base system up to date we need to use the freebsd-update utility.</description></item><item><title>Installation Time</title><link>/blog/2017/02/06/Installation-Time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2017 22:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2017/02/06/Installation-Time/</guid><description>Hi there,
Taking over where i left before, so now i do have a fresh and shiny new machine, time to set it up.
As previously stated, the intended OS for this gig is FreeBSD, so there i am, discovering the Online Administration Console, trying to figure out what to do with this stuff.
Has it happens, there are a few installation procedures availables &amp;ldquo;out-of-the-box&amp;rdquo;, letting you setup your server within the web console, for a bunch of OS, including FreeBSD, but - yeah there is always a but - the FreeBSD 11 install procedure only support the UFS filesystem.</description></item></channel></rss>
