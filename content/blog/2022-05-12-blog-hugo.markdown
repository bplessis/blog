So ...
Hi back i guess ? :)

Years have passed, the previous engine setup proved unreliable, update to jekyll, ruby, and whatever keep breaking up the thing in all ways i could not even think of.
Jekyll-assets particularly seem to have a pretty hard time keeping up with the ecosystem, so ... let's try another way i guess ?

# Hugo #

So i found this tool, Hugo, basically the same concept as jekyll but based on a go software, hopefully it would prove more reliable ?

And there is even an import tool !
{{< highlight shell >}}
# hugo import jekyll blog blog-hugo
Importing...
Congratulations! 18 post(s) imported!
Now, start Hugo by yourself:
$ git clone https://github.com/spf13/herring-cove.git blog-hugo/themes/herring-cove
$ cd blog-hugo
$ hugo server --theme=herring-cove
{{< / highlight >}}

Noice !
Continuing:

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ git clone https://github.com/spf13/herring-cove.git blog-hugo/themes/herring-cove

Oookay, so as it turms out, the 'herring-cove' suggested default theme is actualy not compatible with recents hugo, some deprecated variables are still in use like '.Hugo' and '.RSSLinks'

Much better !

## Converting Post Meta tags

While hugo and jekyll use basically the same way to describe a post meta (title, date, tags, ..) and most of the difference is usually being taken care thru the import tool, there is actually two modifications that often need to be taken care of:
 * categories and tags must be defined as a list using angled brackets ("[]")
 * categories and tags value must often be enclosed in quotes.
 
{{< highlight markdown >}}
---
categories: [ 'blog' ]
tags: [ "hugo" ] 
...
---
{{< / highlight >}}

## Converting syntax highlighting

The conversion should be taken care of by the ```hugo import``` process, however a simple sed line could always take care of it later if needed:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sed -i 's/{% highlight \(.*\) %}/\{\{< highlight \1 >}}/;s/{% endhighlight %}/\{\{< \/ highlight >}}/' *.md *.markdow
{{< / highlight >}}
