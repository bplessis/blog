Hi,

My name is Benoit Plessis and this is my blog.

I've been a system administrator and engineer for almost fifteen years now, mostly running internet websites and this is my first real online presence :)

I'm also an amateur photograph and horse rider.

This blog is powered by jekyll, You can find the source code for Jekyll at
